          <h2 class="article-title">Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Learning and reasoning with graph-structured representations is gaining increasing interest in both academia and industry, due to its fundamental advantages over more traditional unstructured methods in supporting interpretability, causality, and transferability
            / inductive generalization. Recently, there is a surge of new techniques in the context of deep learning, such as graph neural networks, for learning graph representations and performing reasoning and prediction, which have achieved impressive
            progress. However, it can still be a long way to go to obtain satisfactory results in long-range multi-step reasoning, scalable learning with very large graphs, flexible modeling of graphs in combination with other dimensions such as temporal
            variation and other modalities such as language and vision. New advances in theoretical foundations, models and algorithms, as well as empirical discoveries and applications are therefore all highly desirable. The aims of this workshop are
            to bring together researchers to dive deeply into some of the most promising methods which are under active exploration today, discuss how we can design new and better benchmarks, identify impactful application domains, encourage discussion
            and foster collaboration.
